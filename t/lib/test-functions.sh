# t/lib/test-functions - TAP utils for POSIX sh
#
# USAGE:
#   make a plan, then run your tests!
#
# FOR:
#   Bourne shells (bash, ksh, ash... should be good.)
#   NOT for CShell, sorry :(
#
# NOTE:
#   Don't use set -e if you want to take advantage of $? :)
#   Namely, note() diag() ok() all thrive on $?.
#   They act as no-ops, so it is possible to write:
#
#      /path/to/danger blah blah >out
#
#      note "danger squeaked"
#      note <out
#
#      ok "danger was safe" || diag "danger died with $?"
#
# GLOBALS:
#   $a, $b          temp variables
#   $x, $y          even more variables
#   $c              test counter
#   $r              return value
#   $PLAN           # of planned tests
#

# Here is something for me.  Most functions here are inspired
# by Test::More, so it's only natural that I port die too :)
#
# Don't actually call this while testing... this is not xUnit,
# we want all the tests to actually run, not give up midway
# when anything non-critical fails.  Use `say no' for that.

#     plan 10                             # run 10 tests
#     plan 0 "SKIP I feel sick today"     # skip all with reason
